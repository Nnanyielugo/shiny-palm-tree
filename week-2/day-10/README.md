## Tenth day of learning solidity

Read the official Solidity [documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/)

### WILT

- difference between using ^ and >= to specify solidity versions. ^ limits compatibility to patch versions, while >= allows minor or even major version upgrades. This is not ideal as possible breaking changes do not ensure that old code will be compatible with minor version upgrades.
- reading docs for Solidity lang 0.8.9 so being updated with latest language features. Until now, been working with ~0.5x so significant change in language features expected. Named imports for example.
- enum types.
- default type values.
- reverting transactions using the `revert` function. Can be used along with errors.
- value types and contract types.
